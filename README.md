# Purchasing-Power-Prediction-using-ML

## Overview

This project, developed as part of an academic Financial Modeling course, aims to predict purchasing power using machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The models are trained on a dataset of economic indicators, with performance evaluated through metrics like MSE and RÂ², visualized via bar and scatter plots. Accurate prediction of purchasing power supports economic planning, policy-making, and business strategies by providing insights into consumer spending potential and economic trends.
